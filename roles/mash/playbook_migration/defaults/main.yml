# Controls if the old apt repository for Docker (`signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/docker.asc`) will be removed,
# so that the Docker role (7.2.0+) can install a new non-conflicting one (`signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc`).
#
# Without this migration, the role would choke at the "galaxy/docker : Add Docker repository." task when trying to add the repository again:
# > An exception occurred during task execution. To see the full traceback, use -vvv.
